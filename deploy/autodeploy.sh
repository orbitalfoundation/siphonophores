# Runs ON the siphon VM (installed by deploy/setup-autodeploy.sh, fired by a
# systemd timer). Polls GitHub main; when the SHA moves, pulls, rebuilds the
# bundle, and syncs dist/ into /srv/site — Caddy picks the new files up at once.
#
# No secrets: the repo is public, so a plain https ls-remote/fetch works.
# Overlap-safe without a lockfile: the systemd timer re-arms only after the
# previous oneshot run finishes (OnUnitInactiveSec).
